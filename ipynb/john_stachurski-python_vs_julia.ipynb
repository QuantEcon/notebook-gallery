Python is massively popular for both general purpose and scientific computing (see, e.g., [this ranking](https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2018)).  Its popularity is partly due to (and partly caused by) the huge range of third party libraries.  Within the scientific domain, these libraries include high quality array processing software and a powerful JIT compiler.  If Python is \"too slow\" for scientific computing in economics, why is that not the case in, say, astrophysics or machine learning?\n",
                "\n",
                "2. There has been some discussion in the past about making parts of Julia interpreted rather than compiled, since JIT compilation makes debugging harder and adds other complications.  Moreover, if one considers, say, a large plotting library, then very little of the code base will be critical to performance.  So why compile it?  In a sense, compiling the entire code base is a form of premature optimization --- decried as the \"root of all evil\" by [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth), one of the greats of scientific computing.  In contrast, Python is interpreted and JIT compilation is judiciously applied to small parts of one's code base.  Perhaps this is the sweet spot for scientific computing that Python has somehow stumbled into?\n",

This matters because memory access patterns can always be optimized, especially in small problems as treated here.  One would have to take into account all the individual features of the programming languages to make a fair comparison. (Most likely there would be no surprise, as their performance behavior is known.)  We follow AFV in simply reporting timings but a useful reference for the topics listed above is: S. Goedecker and A. Hoisie. Performance Optimization of Numerically Intensive Codes (SIAM), 2001. ISBN 978-0898714845. "
